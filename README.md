# sfGUI

- **sfGUI** is an Immediate Mode GUI library built on top of the SFML ([Simple and Fast Multimedia Layer](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)) library.
- This is still a work in progress.

# Current status: ðŸ”´
- **More details:**
- Currently the library seg faults and I need a debugger (which I don't have since I'm using NeoVim to write this) to check where that seg fault happens since I added a lot of stuff and I have no idea what broke it.
- If you wish to check out a working version of this library I recommend loading the first commit which has somewhat functional code.

# Supported platforms:
- _Currently the only platform supported is **Linux** and a **system-wide install** of SFML is required to run this library._
- _Note:_ I will add support for other platforms after I am done with a prototype of the library. Until then... _works on my machine :)_
